# JavaScript Chatbot 

This is a very simple "chatbot" using nothing but JavaScript, HTML, & CSS. I put this in quotes because chatbots these days are way more complex - this is an exercise in vanilla JS loops and conditionals, not AI.

I hope it makes a good intro for anyone interested in chatbots and frontend fundamentals.

Enjoy!
